# HTML-TIME

https://setyourwatchby.netlify.com

A ludicrous experiment triggered by a playfull tweet:

> free side project idea: HTML-only static site generated clock that deploys a new version to @netlify every minute
> â€“ [@zachleat](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1020034115817680896)


## What does it do?

- It builds a page with the local time for a variety of timezones. (correct at build time.)
- When served on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=setyourwatch-pnh&utm_campaign=devex)'s global CDN, visitors are routed to the correct page for them based on the country they access from.

## What on earth for?

Since we can run this build so regularly and with such confidence on Netlify, we rebuild and deploy automatically every minute.

## Are you an idiot?

Possibly. But it turns out that this is a nice example of how the country-specific CDN routing is on Netlify thanks to its concise, yet powerful [`_redirects`](_redirects) API. ([docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=setyourwatch-pnh&utm_campaign=devex))

Have a poke around!

## Deployed (really rather often) to Netlify

## Format for localisations

Pages for different locales follow the [conventions set out on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
